## Welcome to GitHub Pages

There are two implementation in this project. 1st is the cloth simulation with self-collision detection (extremly slow). The 2nd implementation is advance collision detection using
OBB. 

1st: https://ajgavane.github.io/AdvanceGraphicsProject/clothSimulation.html
2nd: https://ajgavane.github.io/AdvanceGraphicsProject/index.html

Controls 
1st: 'w', 'a', 's', 'd' for ball control.
2nd: 'w', 'a', 's', 'd' for pyramid control. 'q' & 'e' for motion along vertical axis. 'f' to see the triangluated view of models used. 'b' for seeing OBB of an object.
'i', 'j', 'k' & 'l' for rotating the complex model used in the demo. 
You can have camera control over both the demos using mouse.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/AJgavane/AdvanceGraphicsProject/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
